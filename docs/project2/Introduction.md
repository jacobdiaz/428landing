## Project 2 - Circus VR (Scare Co.)

![Screen Shot 2021-10-17 at 4 21 23 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54045615/137645456-1d5ad643-c8ca-459c-b73a-37c06490816b.png)

### Overview

- **Coulrophobia** is the official title for the fear of _circuses_, _carnivals_, and _clowns_. This space is a VR experience that attempts to address coulrophobia by putting users directly in a space that resembles their darkest fear. Users are able to walk around and interact with items and feel as though they are actually in a circus. This could help users to feel comfortable in this type of environment without actually physically being in the space.
- As a user feel free to walk around the two floors and interact with items such as circus balls, swords, boxes, hotdogs, and tickets. Check out the various circus animals on the first floor and even try your hand on an elevated tight rope.
