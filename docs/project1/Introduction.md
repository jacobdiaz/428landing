## üóí About the Project

The task for this project was to create a Knick Knack souvenir for two different locations. The two locations I chose for this project was **_New York City, USA_** üóΩ and **_Monte Carlo, Monaco_** üèé.

Project 1 is a AR application that you can run in Unity using the [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/) tool kit. This project uses the [Class Cube](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F3aQb9lofJemZIDLws2UdalqnUfA_NFk?usp=sharing) and the [Merge Cube](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FhT4Fzl-KmAgjcFUIupuNcF9Zw6ujLR1?usp=sharing) as trackable objects. The Merge Cube in this project is correlated with the Monaco knick knack and the Class Cube is correlated with the New York City knick knack.

They also both display a mock magic 8 ball that produces random responses.
