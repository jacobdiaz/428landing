The two cities I chose for my knick knacks are **New York City, USA** ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸and **Monte Carlo, Monaco** ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨.

For New York City I chose to use one of it's major landmarks, the Statue of Liberty. I also added clouds in my knick knack to represent the tall sky scrapers in the city. Since New York has a nickname of "_The Big Apple_" I chose to put giant apples in the clouds. When the object gets into view the sound that plays is what you would typically hear on a New York City street.

On the other hand for Monte Carlo, I chose to theme the knick knack with the cities most notable events, the Monaco Grand Prix for Formula 1. The knick knack has a model of a Charles Leclerc's Formula 1 Car along with a driver helmet and trophy. When the object gets into view the sound that plays is the loud engines of the Formula 1 cars during the race.
