### Negative

  - Since the game is new, much of Horizon Worlds is still empty. More developers need to start building content.
- **Control to Meta**
  - If Meta is able to get billions of users like it has for Facebook and Instagram, one entity will be creating the rules for a VR world
  - A large amount of people can be effected by economic rule change they have no control over. (_much like youtube monetization changes_)
- **Only available for quest devices**
- **Beta stage**
  - Many promised features are still being implemented
  - Isn't linked with other Horizon Platforms
