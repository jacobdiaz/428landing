![Horizon](https://uploadvr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HorizonWorlds_KeyArt_CoverLandscape_2560x1440-1024x576.png)

_**Horizon Worlds**_, is a virtual reality video game, with an integrated game creation system created by Meta. This game is made for Meta's Oculus devices. It is meant to be an open world game where individual users can create their own games, avatars, and social environments where you are able to meet with friends or meet new people. Horizon Worlds is just one branch of the Horizon series with **_Horizon Work Rooms_**, and **_Horizon Home_** as sibling applications. In my presentation I will talk about the pros and cons of this open worlds game, as well as speak about what users it is looking to attract.
