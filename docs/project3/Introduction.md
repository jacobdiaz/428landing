<h1> Project 3 - Circus VR </h1>

### Current Bugs

Due to last minute bugs, the project can only be played via the Spacial simulator. To play the project run the Circus Scene inside of Unity. Because of this the current project will have errors running on the Oculus.

### Overview

This project takes Project 2 and incorporates three additional scenes. The player is able to switch between the scenes through the teleporter room in the back left first floor of every scene.

The **_small circus scene_** takes a looks at turning the original circus scene into a "doll house" where the player is able to place objects inside a doll sized circus.

In the **_Land of Giants_** scene the player is shrunk and is able to interact with small object which are now big, such as the ants on the hot dogs, pen by the ticket booth, and tiger toy in the cage.

Finally the **_Dancing on the Ceiling_** scene depicts the original circus upside down, with the user essentially starting on the ceiling and objects falling from above.
