When someone is going to a different country where the language and even the alphabet can be different. In the pre-internet era, one would have to carry a language-to-language dictionary and actively flip through physical pages in a book looking for a matching translation.

A person could now easily read from a restaurant menu read street signs, or even use public transportation.

A disadvantage I believe could happen is a loss of appreciation for language and writing. Cultures like China, who praise the art of writing Chinese calligraphy would be lost to a digital translation. These things I believe are the reason people travel. Many travel to see the differences from their cultures to others. I think that many people would not like their version of reality to not authentically represent the environment that they are traveling to. As of right now, I think users would also feel distracted as they would constantly see writing change in real time from the native language to theirs. This though I feel could become faster and be less of a distraction."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Googles AR technology offers a lot of utility and will continue to get better and better.
