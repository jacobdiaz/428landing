From there, the user is able to roam around the virtual world exploring creations from other users, as well as creating their own virtual environments. Currently Horizon Worlds is very empty and relies heavily on creators to create different experiences. What makes Horizon Worlds different from current sandbox games like VRChat and Altspace, is that environments in Horizon worlds can be built directly in the game. In VRChat and Altspace, there is a bigger learning curve since users have to learn how to use 3D building software like Unity. On the contrary, Horizon Worlds is geared toward easy to use development. The game uses a drag and drop feature that allows users to manipulate many different primitive shapes by performing gestures that allow them to do things such as scaling, rotating, stretching, and duplicating. Users are also able to create scripts by using easy to use drag and drop code blocks that is similar to the beginner code language, Scratch. These easy to use features will be more inclusive to more developers, as building is simpler and faster."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"A key feature of Horizon Worlds is their way of handling user privacy.

Since Horizon Worlds is much of a public space, they have created privacy features to deal with many issues that they have dealt with on the Facebook platform. Users are able to select in their settings of appearing to be seen or heard in a world. If a user feels they are in a situation where they are being harassed they are easily able to experience the world in isolation without other users.

As much of Horizon Worlds is dictated by the users, people can also feel immersed in a community they find interesting without having to live near any of the people in the community. Large scale virtual enterprise games can be worked on all in a remote virtual environment.

Statistica.com states that Facebook has roughly 2.91 billion users (Statistica.com) and Instagram landing around 1 billion users (Statistica.com).

Another economic issue may be what currency will be used in the Horizon Worlds. Facebook has created Libra, a digital currency used on the Facebook platform for digital purchases.
